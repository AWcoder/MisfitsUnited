## __Section I - League Governence__ ##

### League Commissioner ###
__Austin Woetzel__
> (763) 843-3237

> awwoetzel@gmail.com

<br>

### Backup-Commissioner ###
__TBD__
> 

> 

<br>

### Commissioner Site Powers ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
<br>
### Backup Commissioner Site Powers ###
The Backup Commissioners will have all site powers the league commissioner has so that in the event the commissioner is unavailable the backup commissioners can attend to any urgent needs from league members.
<br>
### Backup Commissioner Appointment ###
The Commissioner can nominate a Backup Commissioners who will then require a majority vote by the rest of the league to be appointed.
<br>
### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie, the commissioner will always have the tiebreaking vote. When an issue arrises where the commissioner has a clear conflict of interest, the matter will be handled by the backup commissioner. If the dispute is between the Commissioner and the Backup Commissioner and both have conflicts of interests, the dispute will be put to a league vote with majority ruling.
<br>
### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive a majority (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote), the commissioner has the option to veto a rule change in which case it can be voted on again and receive a at least 2/3 majority to pass without commissioner consent.
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and the guilty teams will be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid**

<br><br>

## __Section II - League Dues__ ##

### Entry Fee ###
- The Entry Fee for the league is $40 per team.
- Must be paid at minimum 2 weeks before the draft (startup or rookie).

### Yearly Dues ###

- After the first year there is a yearly total of $40 that must be paid 2 weeks before the start of the yearly rookie draft.
- Dues must also be paid for any year a team trades draft picks in.

### Penalties ###
If a team does not pay their dues by the designated date they are not eligible to participate in the draft (startup or rookie) it will be up to the commissioners discretion on whether or not to replace them.

<br><br>

## __Section III - Payout__ ##
- 1st Place: $150 (37.5%)
- 2nd Place: $50 (12.5%)


Additionally $200 (50%) will be rolled over each year into a side pot ("The Empire Pot") that will be awarded to the first team to win back to back championships.

<br><br>
## __Section IV - Empire League Rules__ ##
This is an Empire format dynasty league. This means that the league will disband when one owner wins back to back championships and collects the Empire Pot. The league may be continued with each owner keeping their existing rosters if 100% of owners agree to keep them and continue. Any single owner has the right to require rosters be reset with a new re-draft in order for the league to continue. If the league is continued (either keeping rosters or by re-draft) a new empire pot will be formed.

The winner of a championship will be referred to as the Emperor for the entire next season. To prevent collusion with the Emperor (working together to split the empire pot), the Emperor will be limited in the type of trades they can make during the season (see trades section below).

<br><br>
## __Section IV - Rosters__ ##


   Position | Starters | Maximum
   -------- |--------- | -------
   QB | 2 | No Limit
   RB | 2 | No Limit
   WR | 2 | No Limit
   TE | 1 | No Limit
   FLEX (RB/WR/TE) | 2 | No Limit
   BE | 16 | N/A
   IR | 2 | N/A

<br><br>

## __Section V - Free Agency & Trading__ ##

### Free Agency ###

- Each team will receive $400 for a Free Agency Aquisition Budget (FAAB) for each season.
- Minimum bid to get a FA off waivers is $0
- Per transaction fee is $0
- FAAB dollars can be used as a part of a trade.
- Waviers are continuous and will be processed Wednesday through Sunday at 11:00 AM each day.
- Offseason waviers for free agents will be processed every day at 11:00 AM.


### Trades ###
- Trades will be processed right away, if collusion is suspected the matter will be put to a vote.
- Any trades involving draft picks must be reported to the commissioner.
- During the offseason trading is still allowed. Offseason begins immediately following the championship week.
- Trade deadline is one week before the playoffs begin (Sunday @ 12:00 CT).
- Draft picks up to 2 years in the future are tradable.
- Future season FAAB cannot be traded 
- The Emperor (winner of the previous season) is only allowed to make trades that involve receiving future season draft picks in exchange for rostered players, current season draft picks, and FAAB. The Emperor is not allowed to aquire any players or FAAB via trade. The Emperor still has rights to any current season draft picks (or conditional draft picks) they aquired before becoming the Emperor. 
Example for clarification: If the Emperor wins the championship in the 2018 season, they are not allowed to aquire any 2019 picks, players, or 2019 FAAB via trade during the 2019 season. If the Emperor aquired any 2019 picks via trade during 2018 season, they retain rights to those picks. The 2018 season ends and the 2019 season begins the moment the Emperor wins the 2018 championship.

<br><br>

## __Section VI - Startup Draft__ ##
- Aucton format ($400 budget).

<br><br>

## __Section VII - Rookie Draft__ ##

### Rookie Draft Order ###
- The draft order for the rookie draft will be determined based on both regular and post-season results
- Picks 1-8 will be assigned in inverse order of the regular season standings. Standings determined by regular season record with a tiebreaker of total points scored. 3rd place game in the postseason is meaningless for determining draft order because there is no payout.
- Picks 9-10 will be assigned in inverse order of the postseason standings


### Rookie Draft Settings ###
- There will be 5 rounds of the rookie draft.
- The rookie draft will take place following the completion of the NFL draft.
- The draft will follow a linear format just like the NFL draft (1.01 has 2.01, 3.01, 4.01 etc.)
- Trading draft picks is allowed during the rookie draft
- Draft format is pending league discussion.

__Any undrafted rookie will be treated as a common FA. If they are unavailable in the database you must message the commissioner to claim them and leave a spot open on your roster once they confirm your request. If no spot is open when the player becomes available then there will be no priority given to the team that claimed them__

<br><br>

## __Section VIII - Divisions & Schedule__ ##

### Divisions ###

- There will be two divisions that teams will be randomly assigned to upon joining the league.
- Divisions will not have any bearing on playoffs and winning a division only entitles the winner to bragging rights


### Regular Season Schedule ###
- The regular season lasts from week 1 to week 13.
- Teams will play their first and last two matches against the other teams in their division.

- Playoffs begin week 14 with the championship game occuring week 16.

<br><br>

## __Section IX - Playoffs__ ##

### Championship Bracket ###

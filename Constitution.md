## __Section I - League Governence__ ##

### League Commissioner ###
__Austin Woetzel__
> (763) 843-3237

> awwoetzel@gmail.com

<br>

### Backup Commissioner ###
__Dan Wanous__
> (league founder)

> 

<br>

### Commissioner Site Powers ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
<br>

### Backup Commissioner Site Powers ###
The Backup Commissioners will have all site powers the league commissioner has so that in the event the commissioner is unavailable the backup commissioners can attend to any urgent needs from league members.
<br>

### Backup Commissioner Appointment ###
If the backup commissioner is replaced, the Commissioner can nominate a new backup commissioner who will then require a majority vote by the rest of the league to be appointed.
<br>

### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. The comissioner  may decide to handle an issue with a league vote. In the event of a tie, the commissioner's vote will count as the tie breaking vote. When an issue arrises where the commissioner has a clear conflict of interest, the matter will be handled by the backup commissioner. If the dispute is between the Commissioner and the Backup Commissioner and both have conflicts of interests, the dispute will be put to a league vote with majority ruling.
<br>

### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive a majority (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote), the commissioner has the option to veto a rule change in which case it can be voted on again and receive a at least 2/3 majority to pass without commissioner consent.
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and the guilty teams may penalized draft picks or be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid. Punishment will be determined by the commissioner and require majority vote by non-involved parties to be enforced.**

<br><br>

## __Section II - League Dues__ ##

### Entry Fee ###
- The Entry Fee for the league is $40 per team.
- Must be paid at minimum 2 weeks before the draft (startup or rookie).

### Yearly Dues ###

- After the first year there is a yearly total of $40 that must be paid 2 weeks before the start of the yearly rookie draft.
- Dues will be collected via leagesafe.com

### Penalties ###
If a team does not pay their dues by the designated date they are not eligible to participate in the draft (startup or rookie) it will be up to the commissioners discretion on whether or not to replace them.

<br><br>

## __Section III - Payout__ ##
- 1st Place: $150 (37.5%)
- 2nd Place: $50 (12.5%)


Additionally, $200 (50%) will be rolled over each year into a side pot ("The Empire Pot") that will be awarded to the first team to win back to back championships.

Payouts will occur using leaguesafe.com

<br><br>
## __Section IV - Empire League Rules__ ##
This is an Empire format dynasty league. This means that the league will disband when one owner wins back to back championships and collects the Empire Pot. The league may be continued with each owner keeping their existing rosters if 100% of owners agree to keep them and continue. Any single owner has the right to require rosters be reset with a new re-draft in order for the league to continue. If the league is continued (either keeping rosters or by re-draft) a new empire pot will be formed.

The winner of a championship will be referred to as the Emperor for the entire next season. To prevent collusion with the Emperor (working together to split the empire pot), the Emperor will be limited in the type of trades they can make during the season (see trades section below).

<br><br>
## __Section V - Rosters__ ##


   Position | Starters | Maximum
   -------- |--------- | -------
   QB | 2 | No Limit
   RB | 2 | No Limit
   WR | 2 | No Limit
   TE | 1 | No Limit
   FLEX (RB/WR/TE) | 2 | No Limit
   BE | 16 | N/A
   IR | 2 | N/A

<br><br>

## __Section VI - Free Agency & Trading__ ##

### Free Agency ###

- Each team will receive $400 for a Free Agency Aquisition Budget (FAAB) for each season.
- Minimum bid to get a FA off waivers is $0
- Per transaction fee is $0
- FAAB dollars can be used as a part of a trade.
- Waviers during the regular season are continuous and will be processed Mon, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, and Sun at 11:00 AM each day.
- Offseason waviers for free agents will be processed every day at 11:00 AM.


### Trades ###
- Trades will be processed right away, if collusion is suspected the matter will be put to a vote.
- Any trades involving draft picks must be reported to the commissioner immediately to verify that the draft picks are available for trade.
- During the offseason trading is still allowed. Offseason begins immediately following the championship week.
- Trade deadline is one week before the playoffs begin (Sunday @ 12:00 CT).
- Draft picks up to 2 years in the future are tradable.
- Future season FAAB cannot be traded 
- "Rental" trades are not allowed. Players cannot be traded on a temporary basis before being returned to the original owner.
- Conditional trades are allowed (trade happening based on some future condition), however the future condition cannot be a decision made by another owner or the future league standings. Conditions must be based on something that it out of an owner or the league's control. For example: a player injury, suspension, etc. All trades are final as soon as the conditions are set and agreed upon. An owner cannot agree to a trade where they are allowed to make a future decision to reverse the trade if they get cold feet, their player isn't performing as well as expected, they're eliminated from playoff contention, etc. The conditions of the trade cannot be based on the performance of a team, for example, trade X will happen if my team wins the league or makes the playoffs, etc.
- The Emperor (winner of the previous season) is allowed to make trades for future season draft picks in exchange for rostered players, current season draft picks, and FAAB. The Emperor is not allowed to aquire any players or FAAB via trade. 
Example for clarification: If the Emperor wins the championship in the 2018 season, they are not allowed to aquire any players, or 2019 FAAB via trade during the 2019 season. The 2018 season ends and the 2019 season begins the moment the Emperor wins the 2018 championship. 
- The Emperor can trade for a player only if the terms of the trade are that he receives that player at the start of a future season (so that the player cannot help them win in the current season).
- If the Emperor aquired any current season picks (including conditional picks) via trade during previous season, they retain rights to those picks. 
- The Emporor may not trade for any current season draft picks before or during the rookie draft with one exception: The Emperor may trade for current season picks in exchange for their own higher value picks from the current season (it is assumed that they would do this to aquire future season draft picks in the process because that is the only other thing they can aquire via trade). They must exchange current season picks in a 1:1 ratio (so as to not add any depth to their team). Example: The Emperor can trade #1 and #11 picks in exchange for another team's #2 and #12 picks. They would not be allowed to exhange their #1 pick for anothers teams #12 and #22 because this is not in a 1:1 ratio. They could not trade #1 and #24 for #12 and #15 because this is not decreasing value in a 1:1 ratio (#15 is an increase in value over #24).
- One-sided trades in an attempt to stop the Emperor from a repeat victory will not be tolerated. This is considered a form of collusion.

<br><br>

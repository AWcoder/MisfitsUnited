## __Section I - League Governence__ ##

### League Commissioner ###
__Austin Woetzel__

<br>

### Backup Commissioner ###
__Dan Wanous__
> (league founder)

> 

<br>

### Commissioner Site Powers ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
<br>

### Backup Commissioner Site Powers ###
The Backup Commissioners will have all site powers the league commissioner has so that in the event the commissioner is unavailable the backup commissioners can attend to any urgent needs from league members.
<br>

### Backup Commissioner Appointment ###
If the backup commissioner is replaced, the Commissioner can nominate a new backup commissioner who will then require a majority vote by the rest of the league to be appointed.
<br>

### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. The comissioner  may decide to handle an issue with a league vote. In the event of a tie, the commissioner's vote will count as the tie breaking vote. When an issue arrises where the commissioner has a clear conflict of interest, the matter will be handled by the backup commissioner. If the dispute is between the Commissioner and the Backup Commissioner and both have conflicts of interests, the dispute will be put to a league vote with majority ruling.
<br>

### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive a majority (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote), the commissioner has the option to veto a rule change in which case it can be voted on again and receive a at least 2/3 majority to pass without commissioner consent.

In order to change the number of positions in the starting lineup, 100% of owners must vote in favor for the rule to go in effect for the current season. If 2/3 majority are in favor, the change will go into effect the following season. Changes to the starting lineup are critical to the construction and strategy of team building, thus the reason for the increased voting requirement when compared to other rule changes.
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and the guilty teams may penalized draft picks or be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid. Punishment will be determined by the commissioner and require majority vote by non-involved parties to be enforced.**

<br><br>

## __Section II - League Dues__ ##

### Entry Fee ###
- The Entry Fee for the league is $40 per team.
- Must be paid at minimum 2 weeks before the draft (startup or rookie).

### Yearly Dues ###

- After the first year there is a yearly total of $40 that must be paid 2 weeks before the start of the yearly rookie draft.
- Dues will be collected via leagesafe.com

### Penalties ###
If a team does not pay their dues by the designated date they are not eligible to participate in the draft (startup or rookie) it will be up to the commissioners discretion on whether or not to replace them.

<br><br>

## __Section III - Payout__ ##
- 1st Place: $150 (37.5%)
- 2nd Place: $50 (12.5%)


Additionally, $200 (50%) will be rolled over each year into a side pot ("The Empire Pot") that will be awarded to the first team to win back to back championships.

Payouts will occur using leaguesafe.com. The commissioner will allocate payout amounts, and approval of the allocation is required by majority of owners before leaguesafe will authorize payment.

<br><br>
## __Section IV - Empire League Rules__ ##
This is an Empire format dynasty league. This means that the league will disband when one owner wins back to back championships and collects the Empire Pot. The league may be continued with each owner keeping their existing rosters and future draft picks if 100% of owners agree to keep them and continue. Any single owner has the right to require rosters be reset with a new re-draft in order for the league to continue. If the league is continued (either keeping rosters or by re-draft) a new empire pot will be formed.

The winner of a championship will be referred to as the Emperor for the entire next season. To prevent collusion with the Emperor (working together to split the empire pot), the Emperor will be limited in the type of trades they can make during the season (see trades section below).

<br><br>
## __Section V - Rosters__ ##


   Position | Starters | Maximum
   -------- |--------- | -------
   QB | 2 | No Limit
   RB | 2 | No Limit
   WR | 2 | No Limit
   TE | 1 | No Limit
   FLEX (RB/WR/TE) | 2 | No Limit
   BE | 21 | N/A
   IR | 2 | N/A

<br><br>
Note: Starting in the 2020 season there will be 3 starting Flex spots. This was voted on and approved by 2/3 of the leage during the 2019 offseason.

## __Section VI - Free Agency & Trading__ ##

### Free Agency ###

- Each team will receive $400 for a Free Agency Aquisition Budget (FAAB) for each season.
- Minimum bid to get a FA off waivers is $0
- Per transaction fee is $0
- FAAB dollars can be used as a part of a trade.
- Waviers during the regular season are continuous and will be processed Mon, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, and Sun at 11:00 AM each day.
- Offseason waviers for free agents will be processed every day at 11:00 AM.


### Trades ###
- Trades will be processed right away, if collusion is suspected the matter will be put to a vote.
- Any trades involving draft picks must be reported to the commissioner immediately to verify that the draft picks are available for trade.
- During the offseason trading is still allowed. Offseason begins immediately following the championship week.
- Trade deadline is two weeks before the playoffs begin. Playoffs are in week 14 so all trades must be complete before the first NFL game is played in week 12. NOTE: ESPN only allows certain dates and times as the trade deadline, so this date may end up being 1 day before the first NFL game is played in week 12. 
- No trades of any type are allowed after the trade deadline.
- Draft picks up to 2 years in the future are tradable.
- Future season FAAB cannot be traded 
- "Rental" trades are not allowed. Players cannot be traded on a temporary basis before being returned to the original owner.
- Conditional trades are allowed (trade happening based on some future condition), however the future condition cannot be a decision made by another owner or the future league standings. Conditions must be based on something that is out of an owner or the league's control. For example: a player injury, suspension, etc. All trades are final as soon as the conditions are set and agreed upon. An owner cannot agree to a trade where they are allowed to make a decision to reverse the trade for any reason, for example: if they get cold feet after the trade processes, they're eliminated from playoff contention, etc. The conditions of the trade cannot be based on the performance of a team, for example, trade X will happen if my team wins the league or makes the playoffs, etc.

Special Trading Rules Regarding the Emperor
- When making any trades, the Emperor must follow this core principle: They may not aquire any asset that will help them repeat championships and collect the Empire pot. This is to prevent collusion.
- The Emperor is allowed to make trades for future season draft picks in exchange for rostered players, current season draft picks, and FAAB. The Emperor is not allowed to aquire any players or FAAB for their roster that would help them repeat championships. 
Example for clarification: If the Emperor wins the championship in the 2018 season, they are not allowed to aquire any players, or 2019 FAAB via trade during the 2019 season. The 2018 season ends and the 2019 season begins the moment the Emperor wins the 2018 championship. 
- The Emperor cannot aquire FAAB in a trade.
- The Emporor may not trade for any current season draft picks before or during the rookie draft that they are then allowed to roster for the current season with one exception: The Emperor may trade for current season picks in exchange for their own higher value picks from the current season. They must exchange current season picks in a 1:1 ratio (so as to not add any depth to their team). Example: The Emperor can trade #1 and #11 picks in exchange for another team's #2 and #12 picks. They would not be allowed to exhange their #1 pick for anothers teams #12 and #22 because this is not in a 1:1 ratio. They could not trade #1 and #24 for #12 and #15 because this is not decreasing value in a 1:1 ratio (#15 is an increase in value over #24). If any additional player are aquired in the process of trading down, see below. If the Emperor trades up, they are not allowed to roster that player. Rights to the player go to the other owner that was traded with.
- The Emperor can trade for a player only if the terms of the trade are that he receives that player at the start of a future season (so that the player cannot help them win in the current season). This is extended to also include any players acquired during a trade *up* in the draft, though not necessarily in cases of trading down. In the case of a trade up, or the straight up acquisition of a new pick, the Emperor cannot immediately roster the player that he chooses to draft with the pick. He must wait until the following season when he is no longer the Emperor. This is consistent with the idea that no trade can make it easier for him to repeat as champion. The player the emperor drafts in this case will stay on the roster of the owner (We will call them Owner #2) that was traded with for the entire next season where they can be used in owner #2's starting lineup. While the player is in the possesion of owner #2, they may not be dropped or traded by either owner #2 or the emperor unless agreed upon by both parties. 
- Once the emperor owns a current season pick that was aquired after they became emperor, he may use that pick in other trades but the trade conditions may be limited based on the previous agreement made with owner #2 since owner #2 has rights to the player that would be drafted by the emperor during the current season. Unless otherwise specified, the Emperor is required to exchange this pick in a trade for another pick of the same season so that owner #2 is guaranteed something in return for their original trade. A one to one trade is required when exchanging picks in this scenario so that there is not confusion as to which new pick owner #2 will have rights to during the current season. The emperor may not do 2 for 1 or 1 for 2, 3 for 1 etc. It is encouraged that owner number 2 specify how far the Emperor can trade down with their pick so that they can't solicit a massive trade down, hugely devaluing the player Team 2 would be stuck temporarily rostering (exchanging 1.01 for 5.10 and a future season draft pick, for example). The emperor and owner #2 are free to set other terms that may be different than what is above, as long as owner #2 agrees to the risk associated with the Emperor exchanging that asset for something else.
- All trades that the Emperor would make to aquire a current season pick using another current season pick (lower or higher) that was also aquired after they became emperor (with current season rights to another owner) must be a 1 for 1 trade with the current season picks involved. Other future season pick assets will be involved, but there cannot be mulitple current season picks invovled. The purpose of this is to provide clarity as to which new pick the owner #2 has future season rights to. 
- Example to clarify the above, the Emperor trades Player X to owner# 2 for the 1.01 pick. The Emperor and owner #2 must come to an agreement at the time of that trade that establishes that owner#2 will roster the player chosen with the aforementioned pick for the duration of the current season. Then, the player is conveyed to the Emperor (who would no longer be the Emperor at that point). The Emperor, once in possession of the draft pick (1.01 in this example), is free to trade the pick as he chooses. When the original trade between the Emperor and owner #2 was agreed upon, one further stipulation must be noted. There must be agreement on how far the Emperor is allowed to trade down, since ownver #2 is tacitly agreeing to roster whatever player that will be chosen with one draft pick (though it is not necessarily the 1.01, due to a potential trade down). This agreement is 100% up to the two teams at hand. For example, owner #2 may only feel comfortable rostering a player chosen in the top-10. Thus, once the Emperor bought the 1.01 pick, he would be free to solicit trade downs, but only to the 1.10 slot, no lower. Therefore, owner #2 is protected from being bound to roster a player no matter what, in the event that the Emperor decides to solicit a massive trade down, hugely devaluing the player owner #2 would be stuck temporarily rostering.
- If the Emperor aquired any current season picks (including conditional picks) via trade during the previous season, they retain rights to those picks and can use those players in the current season to help them repeat championships. 
- One-sided trades in an attempt to stop the Emperor from a repeat victory will not be tolerated. This is considered a form of collusion. However, it is understood that rebuilding will be an important part any dynasty league and what looks like a one sided trade may be necessary for the rebuilding team to aquire future assets. This type of trade will only be vetoed if there is obvious collusion involved.

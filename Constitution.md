## __Section I - League Governence__ ##

### League Commissioner ###
__Austin Woetzel__

<br>

### Backup Commissioner ###
__Dan Wanous__
> (league founder)

> 

<br>

### Commissioner Site Powers ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
<br>

### Backup Commissioner Site Powers ###
The Backup Commissioners will have all site powers the league commissioner has so that in the event the commissioner is unavailable the backup commissioners can attend to any urgent needs from league members.
<br>

### Backup Commissioner Appointment ###
If the backup commissioner is replaced, the Commissioner can nominate a new backup commissioner who will then require a majority vote by the rest of the league to be appointed.
<br>

### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. The comissioner  may decide to handle an issue with a league vote. In the event of a tie, the commissioner's vote will count as the tie breaking vote. When an issue arrises where the commissioner has a clear conflict of interest, the matter will be handled by the backup commissioner. If the dispute is between the Commissioner and the Backup Commissioner and both have conflicts of interests, the dispute will be put to a league vote with majority ruling.
<br>

### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive a majority (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote), the commissioner has the option to veto a rule change in which case it can be voted on again and receive a at least 2/3 majority to pass without commissioner consent.

In order to change the number of positions in the starting lineup, 100% of owners must vote in favor for the rule to go in effect for the current season. If 2/3 majority are in favor, the change will go into effect the following season. Changes to the starting lineup are critical to the construction and strategy of team building, thus the reason for the increased voting requirement when compared to other rule changes.
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and the guilty teams may penalized draft picks or be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid. Punishment will be determined by the commissioner and require majority vote by non-involved parties to be enforced.**

<br><br>

## __Section II - League Dues__ ##

### Entry Fee ###
- The Entry Fee for the league is $40 per team.
- Must be paid at minimum 2 weeks before the draft (startup or rookie).

### Yearly Dues ###

- After the first year there is a yearly total of $40 that must be paid 2 weeks before the start of the yearly rookie draft.
- Dues will be collected via leagesafe.com

### Penalties ###
If a team does not pay their dues by the designated date they are not eligible to participate in the draft (startup or rookie) it will be up to the commissioners discretion on whether or not to replace them.

<br><br>

## __Section III - Payout__ ##
- 1st Place: $150 (37.5%)
- 2nd Place: $50 (12.5%)


Additionally, $200 (50%) will be rolled over each year into a side pot ("The Empire Pot") that will be awarded to the first team to win back to back championships.

Payouts will occur using leaguesafe.com. The commissioner will allocate payout amounts, and approval of the allocation is required by majority of owners before leaguesafe will authorize payment.

<br><br>
## __Section IV - Empire League Rules__ ##
This is an Empire format dynasty league. This means that the league will disband when one owner wins back to back championships and collects the Empire Pot. The league may be continued with each owner keeping their existing rosters and future draft picks if 100% of owners agree to keep them and continue. Any single owner has the right to require rosters be reset with a new re-draft in order for the league to continue. If the league is continued (either keeping rosters or by re-draft) a new empire pot will be formed.

The winner of a championship will be referred to as the Emperor for the entire next season. To prevent collusion with the Emperor (working together to split the empire pot), the Emperor will be limited in the type of trades they can make during the season (see trades section below).

<br><br>
## __Section V - Rosters__ ##


   Position | Starters | Maximum
   -------- |--------- | -------
   QB | 2 | No Limit
   RB | 2 | No Limit
   WR | 2 | No Limit
   TE | 1 | No Limit
   FLEX (RB/WR/TE) | 3 | No Limit
   BE | 18 | N/A
   IR | 2 | N/A
   TAXI | 2 | N/A

NOTE: The Taxi Squad spots will not be added until the 2020 rookie draft is complete. The Bench spots will be reduced from 20 to 18 to counterbalance the addition of the taxi squad at the conclusion of the rookie draft.

2021 and 2022 rules will be changing the taxi and bench roster spots. See taxi squad rules below for more information. 


<br><br>
## __Section VI - Taxi Squad__ ##
Each owner has a taxi squad where they may store developmental players to help them in future seasons.

- All rookies are eligible for placement on the taxi squad.
- Players may be left on the taxi squad for their 1st and 2nd years in the NFL
- 2nd year players are not eligible to be placed on the taxi squad, but they can remain on the taxi squad if there were placed there during their rookie year.
- A player may be moved from the taxi squad to the active roster at any time.
- Rookies may be moved back and forth between taxi and active roster during the offseason and preseason. Final decision on taxi squad rookies are made immediately before the start of the regular season.
- Once a player has been moved off the taxi squad, they may never return back to the taxi squad (with the exception of rookies during the offseason and preseason).
- There is a limit of 7* players on the taxi squad. (*number will be less in the first 2 years, see "Implementation" below)
- Taxi squad players can be traded.


### Active Roster Size ###

Active roster size will be reduced from 30 to 25* to counterbalance the increase in taxi squad roster spots (*number will be higher in the first 2 years, see "Implementation" below)

### Taxi Squad Implementation ###

Because this change increases the value of the later round draft picks and would force cuts in the short term, we would have to implement this in a smart way so that it does not give an advantage to any team that is already structured for this change. We would phase in the rule change over the next 3 years.

2020 rules that are different than the final state outlined above:
- 2 players max on the taxi squad
- Reduction of Active Roster Spots to 28 (18 bench spots)      

2021 rules
- 4 players max on the taxi squad
- Reduction of Active Roster Spots to 27 (17 bench spots)

2022 rules
- 7 players max on the taxi squad
- Reduction of Active Roster Spots to 25 (15 bench spots)

## __Section VII - Free Agency & Trading__ ##

### Free Agency ###

- Each team will receive $400 for a Free Agency Aquisition Budget (FAAB) for each season.
- Minimum bid to get a FA off waivers is $0
- Per transaction fee is $0
- FAAB dollars can be used as a part of a trade.
- Waviers during the regular season are continuous and will be processed Mon, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, and Sun at 11:00 AM each day.
- Offseason waviers for free agents will be processed every day at 11:00 AM.


### Trades ###
- Trades will be processed right away, if collusion is suspected the matter will be put to a vote.
- Any trades involving draft picks must be reported to the commissioner immediately to verify that the draft picks are available for trade.
- During the offseason trading is still allowed. Offseason begins immediately following the championship week.
- Trade deadline is two weeks before the playoffs begin. 
- No trades of any type are allowed after the trade deadline.
- Draft picks up to 2 years in the future are tradable.
- Future season FAAB cannot be traded 
- "Rental" trades are not allowed. Players cannot be traded on a temporary basis before being returned to the original owner.
- Conditional trades are allowed (trade happening based on some future condition), however the future condition cannot be a decision made by another owner or the future league standings. Conditions must be based on something that is out of an owner or the league's control. For example: a player injury, suspension, etc. All trades are final as soon as the conditions are set and agreed upon. An owner cannot agree to a trade where they are allowed to make a decision to reverse the trade for any reason, for example: if they get cold feet after the trade processes, they're eliminated from playoff contention, etc. The conditions of the trade cannot be based on the performance of a team, for example, trade X will happen if my team wins the league or makes the playoffs, etc.

Special Trading Rules Regarding the Emperor
- When making any trades, the Emperor must follow this core principle: They may not aquire any asset that will help them repeat championships and collect the Empire pot. This is to prevent collusion.
- The Emperor is allowed to make trades for future season draft picks in exchange for rostered players, current season draft picks, and FAAB. The Emperor is not allowed to aquire any players or FAAB for their roster that would help them repeat championships. 
Example for clarification: If the Emperor wins the championship in the 2018 season, they are not allowed to aquire any players, or 2019 FAAB via trade during the 2019 season. The 2018 season ends and the 2019 season begins the moment the Emperor wins the 2018 championship. 
- The Emperor cannot aquire FAAB in a trade.
- The Emporor may not trade for any current season draft picks before or during the rookie draft that they are then allowed to roster for the current season with one exception: The Emperor may trade for current season picks in exchange for their own higher value picks from the current season. They must exchange current season picks in a 1:1 ratio (so as to not add any depth to their team). Example: The Emperor can trade #1 and #11 picks in exchange for another team's #2 and #12 picks. They would not be allowed to exhange their #1 pick for anothers teams #12 and #22 because this is not in a 1:1 ratio. They could not trade #1 and #24 for #12 and #15 because this is not decreasing value in a 1:1 ratio (#15 is an increase in value over #24). If any additional player are aquired in the process of trading down, see below. If the Emperor trades up, they are not allowed to roster that player. Rights to the player go to the other owner that was traded with.
- The Emperor can trade for a player only if the terms of the trade are that he receives that player at the start of a future season (so that the player cannot help them win in the current season). This is extended to also include any players acquired during a trade *up* in the draft, though not necessarily in cases of trading down. In the case of a trade up, or the straight up acquisition of a new pick, the Emperor cannot immediately roster the player that he chooses to draft with the pick. He must wait until the following season when he is no longer the Emperor. This is consistent with the idea that no trade can make it easier for him to repeat as champion. The player the emperor drafts in this case will stay on the roster of the owner (We will call them Owner #2) that was traded with for the entire next season where they can be used in owner #2's starting lineup. While the player is in the possesion of owner #2, they may not be dropped or traded by either owner #2 or the emperor unless agreed upon by both parties. 
- Once the emperor owns a current season pick that was aquired after they became emperor, he may use that pick in other trades but the trade conditions may be limited based on the previous agreement made with owner #2 since owner #2 has rights to the player that would be drafted by the emperor during the current season. Unless otherwise specified, the Emperor is required to exchange this pick in a trade for another pick of the same season so that owner #2 is guaranteed something in return for their original trade. A one to one trade is required when exchanging picks in this scenario so that there is not confusion as to which new pick owner #2 will have rights to during the current season. The emperor may not do 2 for 1 or 1 for 2, 3 for 1 etc. It is encouraged that owner number 2 specify how far the Emperor can trade down with their pick so that they can't solicit a massive trade down, hugely devaluing the player Team 2 would be stuck temporarily rostering (exchanging 1.01 for 5.10 and a future season draft pick, for example). The emperor and owner #2 are free to set other terms that may be different than what is above, as long as owner #2 agrees to the risk associated with the Emperor exchanging that asset for something else.
- All trades that the Emperor would make to aquire a current season pick using another current season pick (lower or higher) that was also aquired after they became emperor (with current season rights to another owner) must be a 1 for 1 trade with the current season picks involved. Other future season pick assets will be involved, but there cannot be mulitple current season picks invovled. The purpose of this is to provide clarity as to which new pick the owner #2 has future season rights to. 
- Example to clarify the above, the Emperor trades Player X to owner# 2 for the 1.01 pick. The Emperor and owner #2 must come to an agreement at the time of that trade that establishes that owner#2 will roster the player chosen with the aforementioned pick for the duration of the current season. Then, the player is conveyed to the Emperor (who would no longer be the Emperor at that point). The Emperor, once in possession of the draft pick (1.01 in this example), is free to trade the pick as he chooses. When the original trade between the Emperor and owner #2 was agreed upon, one further stipulation must be noted. There must be agreement on how far the Emperor is allowed to trade down, since ownver #2 is tacitly agreeing to roster whatever player that will be chosen with one draft pick (though it is not necessarily the 1.01, due to a potential trade down). This agreement is 100% up to the two teams at hand. For example, owner #2 may only feel comfortable rostering a player chosen in the top-10. Thus, once the Emperor bought the 1.01 pick, he would be free to solicit trade downs, but only to the 1.10 slot, no lower. Therefore, owner #2 is protected from being bound to roster a player no matter what, in the event that the Emperor decides to solicit a massive trade down, hugely devaluing the player owner #2 would be stuck temporarily rostering.
- If the Emperor aquired any current season picks (including conditional picks) via trade during the previous season, they retain rights to those picks and can use those players in the current season to help them repeat championships. 
- One-sided trades in an attempt to stop the Emperor from a repeat victory will not be tolerated. This is considered a form of collusion. However, it is understood that rebuilding will be an important part any dynasty league and what looks like a one sided trade may be necessary for the rebuilding team to aquire future assets. This type of trade will only be vetoed if there is obvious collusion involved.

<br><br>

## __Section VIII - Startup Draft__ ##
- Aucton format ($400 budget).

<br><br>

## __Section IX - Rookie Draft__ ##

### Rookie Draft Order ###
- The draft order for the rookie draft will be determined based on both regular and post-season results
- Picks 1-4 will be assigned in inverse order of the regular season standings to the non-playoff teams. Standings determined by regular season record with a tiebreaker of total points scored. 
- Picks 5 and 6 will be assigned to the 2 teams eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in inverse order of the regular season standings with a tiebreaker of total points scored.
- Picks 7 and 8 will be assigned to the 2 teams eliminated in the second round of the playoffs in inverse order of the regular season standings with a tiebreaker of total points scored.
- Pick 9 will be assigned to the loser of the championship game
- Pick 10 is assigned to the champion of the season.


### Rookie Draft Settings ###
- There will be 5 rounds of the rookie draft.
- The rookie draft will take place following the completion of the NFL draft.
- The draft will follow a linear format just like the NFL draft (1.01 has 2.01, 3.01, 4.01 etc.)
- Trading draft picks is allowed during the rookie draft
- Free agency is locked during the draft
- Only NFL rookies are eligible to be picked in the Rookie Draft. Non-rookies must be aquired via free agency.


__Any undrafted rookie will be treated as a common FA. If they are unavailable in the database you must message the commissioner to claim them and leave a spot open on your roster once they confirm your request. If no spot is open when the player becomes available then there will be no priority given to the team that claimed them__

<br><br>

## __Section X - Divisions & Schedule__ ##

### Divisions ###

- Divisions determine which teams you will play 2 times during the regular season
- Divisions are reshuffled each season based on the previous season's Potential Points ("Max PF" on the Sleeper App) rankings. Division 1 will have the 1,3,5,7,and 9th ranked teams. Division 2 will have 2,4,6,8, and 10th ranked teams
- Divisions will not have any bearing on playoffs and winning a division only entitles the winner to bragging rights



### Regular Season Schedule ###
- The regular season lasts from week 1 to week 13.
- Teams will play each other team in the league once (9 games) and teams in their division twice (4 games)
- regular season matches are randomly determined at the beginning of the season.
- Playoffs begin week 14 with the championship game occuring week 16.

<br><br>

## __Section XI - Playoffs__ ##

### Championship Bracket ###
- Playoffs are 3 rounds from week 14 to 16
- Playoff seeding is determined by regular season record with a tiebreaker being total points scored throughout the regular season.
- Top 6 teams make the playoffs
- The top two seeds will recieve a first round bye. 
- The first round will be #3 seed vs #6 seed and the #4 seed vs #5 seed.
- The second round will be the #1 seed vs the worst remaning seed and the #2 seed vs the best remaining seed.
- The better seed in each playoff matchup will recieve 2 additional points with the exception of the championship game.

### Consolation Bracket ###
There is no consolation bracket and no incentive for winning or losing games once eliminated from championship contention. Any losses once eliminated from championship contention have no impact on draft position in the next season (see Section VIII Rookie Draft).

<br><br>

## __Section XIII - Offseason__ ##
- The league will be closed immmediately following the championship game. No roster moves will be allowed once the league is closed. The league will be reopned once all rule change discussions and votes have been completed for the next season.


## __Section XIV - COVID Rules__ ##
We will consider our fantasy week to be valid if a minimum of 50% of scheduled games are played. If less than 50% are played we will skip the week and shift our schedule to the next NFL week (repeating all matchups that were in progress). If this happens multiple times and the NFL does not add any weeks to the end of the regular season, then we will treat the results as a shortened season (see rules below). 

The NFL Playoffs will not be used for fantasy purposes, even if the regular season is shortened. Weeks 16 and 17 may be used if up to two weeks are considered “invalid” for our fantasy league.

The trade deadline is always 2 weeks before the start of the fantasy playoffs. If the season is shifted back, so is the trade deadline. 

### Delayed Start ###
Shift our schedule to match the NFL’s. Week 1 starts whenever the NFL week 1 starts

### Interrupted Season (COVID break) ###
Shift our schedule to match the NFL. For example: If the season is delayed weeks 5-9, our week 5 will be played whenever the NFL starts their week 5.

### Full fantasy regular season (13 games), fantasy playoffs cut short: ###

If a full fantasy regular season is played (13 weeks), but the fantasy playoffs are cut short (weeks 14-16), we will still pay 1st and 2nd place out the yearly pot ($200) and crown the champion as Emperor so they have the opportunity to take home the empire pot in 2021. To determine 1st and 2nd place, we will rank by regular season record with a tiebreaker of total points scored, but only for the teams remaining in championship contention. Any teams that made the playoffs but were eliminated in the early rounds  (prior to season cancellation)  will not be eligible.

2021 rookie draft order is determined by the standard method for non-playoff teams and playoff teams that were eliminated from contention prior to season cancellation. For teams that had not been eliminated from the playoffs prior to season cancellation, the draft order will be the reverse order of regular season standings with a tiebreaker of total points scored.

### Less than 13 games, but at least 8 games played ###

In order to mitigate any scheduling advantages. We will change to an “all-play” format for the entire season. In “all-play” everyone plays everyone head-to-head each week and you combine your total record throughout all weeks. For example: if your team finished 3rd in points in week 1, your record would be 7-2. If you finish 5th in points in week 2, your record is 5-4 in week 2 for a combined overall record of 12-6. At the end of the season the top two teams are determined by overall record. Tie breaker is total points scored.

In this scenario, all-play record is re-calculated for all previous weeks already played. The standard head-to-head records that were tracked up to the point of the season being cancelled are no longer used for any reason. 

Payouts remain the same and the champion is crowned Emperor.

The 2021 rookie draft order is determined by reverse order of “all-play” standings.

### Less than 8 games played, more than 4 games played ###

No payouts. All money rolls into 2021.

No League dues in 2021 

 2021 draft order will be determined with an NBA style weighted lottery based on 2019 and 2020 results. 2019 ping pong balls determined by the final 2019 standings.  2020 ping pong balls are determined by the partial regular season “all-play” record with a tie breaker of total points scored.

Ping pong balls are combined together (200 total) for the lottery.
